Here is the production-grade README.md for the FastAPI project:

**pythongenaisrd**
================

**Project Summary**
pythongenaisrd is a FastAPI project that provides a robust and scalable API for managing dashboard data, leave management, project-oriented development, and authentication and authorization. The project is built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy), Alembic, Pydantic, and Pytest.

**Setup & Installation**
-------------------------

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* PostgreSQL 13+
* pip

### Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```
Replace `username`, `password`, `localhost`, `dbname`, and `your_secret_key` with your actual database credentials and secret key.

### Database Setup

Run the following command to create the database schema:
```
alembic upgrade head
```

**How to Run the Server**
-------------------------

Run the following command to start the server:
```
uvicorn app.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

**API Documentation**
-------------------

API documentation is available at:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger)
http://localhost:8000/redoc (ReDoc)
```

**Modular Code Structure**
-------------------------

The project follows a modular code structure, with separate directories for models, services, routers, schemas, and crud operations. This allows for easy maintenance and extension of the API.

**Generated Services and Schemas**
---------------------------------

The project uses Pydantic to generate services and schemas based on the database schema. This ensures that the API is strongly typed and follows the database schema.

**Testing**
----------

The project uses Pytest for unit testing. Run the following command to run the tests:
```
pytest
```

**Security**
----------

The project implements secure authentication using JWT tokens and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). API rate-limiting and end-to-end encryption are also implemented for security.

**Endpoints**
----------

### Dashboard

* `GET /api/dashboard/tiles` - Fetch dashboard data

### LMS (Leave Management System)

* `POST /api/lms/leaves/apply` - Apply for leave
	+ Body: `start_date`, `end_date`, `reason`
* `GET /api/lms/leaves/status` - Retrieve leave status
* `PATCH /api/lms/leaves/{leave_id}/approve` - Approve/reject leave (manager only)
	+ Body: `status`

### PODs (Project Oriented Development)

* `POST /api/pods/assign` - Assign employee to pod
* `GET /api/pods/{pod_id}/details` - Get pod details
* `POST /api/pods/{pod_id}/recommend` - Recommend employee for pod
	+ Body: `recommended_user_id`

### Authentication & Authorization

* `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
	+ Body: `email`, `password`
* `GET /api/auth/user` - Fetch current user details

**Database Schema**
-------------------

### users table

* `id` (primary key)
* `email`
* `password` (hashed)
* `role` (enum: employee, manager)

### leaves table

* `id` (primary key)
* `user_id` (foreign key referencing `users.id`)
* `start_date`
* `end_date`
* `reason`
* `status` (enum: pending, approved, rejected)

### pods table

* `id` (primary key)
* `name`

### pod_members table

* `id` (primary key)
* `pod_id` (foreign key referencing `pods.id`)
* `user_id` (foreign key referencing `users.id`)
* `role`

**Business Logic and Rules**
-----------------------------

### Leave Management

* Employees can apply for leaves with a specific category (e.g., paid leave, sick leave)
* Managers can approve or reject leave requests with comments
* Leave balances are tracked and updated accordingly

### Pods Management

* Managers can assign employees to specific pods
* Employees can view their assigned pod
* Employees can recommend colleagues for inclusion in a pod

### Authentication and Authorization

* Users can log in with their email and password
* Managers have access to both manager and employee-related APIs
* Employees can only access user-specific APIs
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented
