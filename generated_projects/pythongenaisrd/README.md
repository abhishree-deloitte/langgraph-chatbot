Here is the production-grade README.md for the FastAPI project:

**pythongenaisrd**
=====================

**Project Summary**
-----------------

pythongenaisrd is a FastAPI project that provides a robust and scalable API for managing dashboard data, leave management, project-oriented development (PODs), and authentication and authorization. The project is built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy), Alembic, Pydantic, and Pytest.

**Setup & Installation**
-------------------------

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* PostgreSQL 13+
* pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pythongenaisrd.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
	* `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection URL (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname`)
	* `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for token-based authentication (e.g., `secret_key_here`)
6. Run database migrations: `alembic upgrade head`

**How to Run the Server**
-------------------------

1. Run the server: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

**API Docs**
------------

API documentation is available at:

* Swagger: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
* ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

**Modular Code and Generated Services/Schemas**
---------------------------------------------

The project uses modular code organization, with separate directories for models, services, and schemas. The services and schemas are generated using Pydantic, which provides robust data validation and serialization.

**Environment Variables**
-------------------------

The project uses the following environment variables:

* `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection URL
* `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for token-based authentication

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the above variables.

**Testing**
----------

The project uses Pytest for unit testing. Run tests using `pytest`.

**Database Schema**
-------------------

The project uses the following database schema:

* **users table**
	+ `id` (primary key)
	+ `email`
	+ `password` (hashed)
	+ `role` (enum: `manager`, `employee`)
* **leaves table**
	+ `id` (primary key)
	+ `user_id` (foreign key referencing `users.id`)
	+ `start_date`
	+ `end_date`
	+ `reason`
	+ `status` (enum: `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`)
* **pods table**
	+ `id` (primary key)
	+ `name`
* **pod_members table**
	+ `id` (primary key)
	+ `pod_id` (foreign key referencing `pods.id`)
	+ `user_id` (foreign key referencing `users.id`)
	+ `role` (enum: `lead_developer`, `ui_ux_designer`, etc.)

**Business Logic and Rules**
-----------------------------

The project implements the following business logic and rules:

* Leave Management System:
	+ A user can apply for leave with a specific category (e.g., paid leave, sick leave, etc.).
	+ A manager can approve or reject leave requests with comments.
	+ A user can view their granted and pending leave requests.
	+ A user can track their available leave balances.
* Pods:
	+ A manager can assign employees to specific pods.
	+ An employee can view their assigned pod.
	+ An employee can recommend colleagues for inclusion in a pod.
* Authentication and Authorization:
	+ Users can log in with their email and password.
	+ Managers can access both manager and employee-related APIs.
	+ Employees can only access user-specific APIs.

**Authentication and Authorization Requirements**
---------------------------------------------------

The project requires secure authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The system uses a token-based authentication system, where a JWT token is generated upon successful login. The system enforces RBAC, data encryption, and secure API access.
