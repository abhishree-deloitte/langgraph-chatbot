Here is the production-grade README.md for the FastAPI project:

**pythongenaisrd**
=====================

**Project Summary**
---------------

pythongenaisrd is a FastAPI-based project that provides a comprehensive platform for leave management, pod management, and dashboard visualization. The project implements a robust architecture with a PostgreSQL database, utilizing SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database migrations. The API is built using FastAPI, with Pydantic for data modeling and Pytest for testing.

**Setup & Installation**
------------------------

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* PostgreSQL 13+
* pip

### Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials and secret key.

**How to Run the Server**
-------------------------

### Development Mode

Run the following command to start the development server:

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Production Mode

Run the following command to start the production server:

```
gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app.main:app
```

**API Documentation**
-------------------

The API documentation is available at:

* Swagger: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
* ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

**Modular Code Structure**
-------------------------

The project follows a modular code structure, with separate directories for models, services, and API routes. This allows for easy maintenance and extension of the codebase.

* `app/models`: Define database models using Pydantic.
* `app/services`: Implement business logic and database interactions.
* `app/api`: Define API endpoints and routes.
* `app/db`: Initialize the database connection and migrations.

**Generated Services and Schemas**
--------------------------------

The project utilizes generated services and schemas to simplify code maintenance and reduce boilerplate code.

* `app/services/__init__.py`: Automatically generates service classes based on the database models.
* `app/schemas/__init__.py`: Automatically generates schema classes based on the database models.

**Testing**
---------

The project uses Pytest for unit testing and integration testing. Run the following command to execute the tests:

```
pytest
```
